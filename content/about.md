title: About
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Psychoinformatics Lab, University of Texas at Austin.

My work focuses on developing research methods and open-source software for neuroscience and psychology, and especially on making ML tools and practices more available to these research communities.

I am part of the team that develops [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org/), an open-source platform for end-to-end analysis of neuroimaging data, where I focus on workflow validation and on implementing deep learning pipelines for the feature extraction library [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers). I am also working on training [context-aware text transformers](https://github.com/rbroc/personality_reddit), and on mapping cross-national attitudes towards the European Union from a multilingual Twitter corpus (see [Projects](https://rbroc.github.io/projects)).

In Summer 2021, I was a [Data Fellow](https://centre.humdata.org/data-fellows/) in Predictive Analytics at the United Nations' Centre for Humanitarian Data, where I did research on how complex systems predictive modeling techniques can inform humanitarian intervention.

I am a deep learning enthusiast, and I am seeking opportunities to improve my engineering skills while contributing to fairer, more democratic, and more socially impactful AI.
