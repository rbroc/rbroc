Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Psychoinformatics Lab, University of Texas at Austin, and Interacting Minds Centre at Aarhus University.
My background is very interdisciplinary (cognitive science, computational linguistics, and philosophy), and these days I am particularly interested in NLP and its potential to positively impact other research fields and society as a whole.

My current work at UT Austin focuses on developing novel methods and open-source software for neuroscience and psychology, and it is especially centered on making ML tools and practices more available to these research communities.
I am currently contributing to the development of [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org/), a Python-based open-source platform for flexible re-analysis of naturalistic neuroimaging data. I am especially focusing on implementing and validating the use of state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., text transformers) for stimulus annotation through the feature extraction library [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers). I have also done extensive QA testing on the platform's components, and contributed to a large-scale validation of the platform's workflows.
Alongside this, I am working on a project that involves the development of context-aware transformer language models - that is, transformer architectures that learn to produce embeddings of text that are sensitive to characteristics of the author and/or the pragmatic context in which it is produced. </br>

At Aarhus University, I am involved in an applied NLP and computational social science project, where we are using a large corpus of multilingual Twitter data and survey data to map attitudes towards the European Union and mediating political identity. </br>

Driven by my interest in the impact of big data, ML and technology on social good, last summer I worked as a Predictive Analytics Data Fellow at the United Nations' Centre for Humanitarian Data, where I conducted research on how complex systems modeling can be used to inform intervention in humanitarian contexts. </br>

Right now, I am looking for opportunities to improve my ML engineering and NLP skills while also contributing to making ML fairer and increasing its positive impact on areas of research and applications aimed at social good (e.g., clinical research, humanitarian data science). </br>

In my past lives, I was a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience at Aarhus University (as part of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ITN [DCOMM](https://www.dcomm.eu)); a visiting PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), at the National Research Centre (CNR) in Rome, and at the School of Psychology at University of East Anglia; a Master student in Cognitive Science at University of Trento; and a Research Assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen and at University College London.  </br>

I spend a great deal of my free time reading, running, listening to music (from modern jazz to hip-hop), and watching art-house movies. I occasionally do some freelance science and culture journalism, write fiction, and play the bass in an indie rock band.
