Hi there! üññ

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Culture, Cognition and Computation @ Aarhus University (since December 2022). Previously, I was a postdoc @ UT Austin (2019-2022), where I worked with Dr Tal Yarkoni, and Data Fellow at UN OCHA [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/).

I do research at the intersection of NLP, data science, and cognitive science ü§ñ üß† üó£Ô∏è \
My current work focuses on using machine learning and NLP to model human traits and behavior, focusing especially on:
- Inference of [psychiatric conditions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00152-7) and [encoding and inference of cognitive profiles](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.123/)
- Using [computational tools](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/58v5d82w) and [generative models](https://github.com/rbroc/chatbot-conversations) to simulate social phenomena
- Explainable methods to [discriminate between human- and AI-generated text](https://github.com/rbroc/echo)
- Introducing [ML-inspired evaluation practices in cognitive and social sciences](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/25152459211026864) 

I ‚ù§Ô∏è open-source. One of the most exciting projects I have ever taken part in is the development of [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org/), a groundbreaking platform for end-to-end analysis of neuroimaging data (check out our [research paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79277)). As part of the Neuroscout team, I was in charge of implementing deep learning pipelines for the feature extraction library [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers), of validating and testing core analytical workflows, and of supporting feature expansion.

I am also interested in the opportunities opened up by [AI in the humanitarian sector](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2023.1082787/full), and I am always eager to engage in collaborations with researchers and organisations operating in this domain.
