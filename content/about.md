Hi there! üññ

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Culture, Cognition and Computation @ Aarhus University (since December 2022). Previously, I was a postdoc at Psychoinformatics Lab @ UT Austin (2019-2022) and 2021 Data Fellow at UN OCHA's [Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/).

I do research at the intersection of NLP, data science, and cognitive science. My current work focuses especially on developing machine learning and NLP methods for inference of [psychiatric conditions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00152-7) and of individual differences in [cognitive profiles](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.123/), on using computational tools and generative models to simulate and study the dynamics of social phenomena, and on developing explainable methods for [discrimination between human- and AI-generated text](https://github.com/rbroc/echo). ü§ñ üß† üó£Ô∏è

I am also an advocate for the [adoption of ML-inspired evaluation practices in cognitive and social sciences](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/25152459211026864). 

I ‚ù§Ô∏è working on collaborative open-source projects. One of the most exciting projects I have even taken part in is the development of [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org/), a grounbreaking platform for end-to-end analysis of neuroimaging data (see [research paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79277)). As part of the core Neuroscout team, I focused especially on implementing deep learning pipelines for the feature extraction library [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers), on validating and testing core analytical workflows, and on supporting expansion of feature sets and functionality. 

You can read more about my work in my [CV](https://rbroc.github.io/cv/cv.pdf), and in the [Projects](https://rbroc.github.io/projects) section of this website. üöÄ
