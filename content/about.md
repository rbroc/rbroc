Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher with [Tal Yarkoni](https://talyarkoni.org/) in the Psychoinformatics Lab, [Department of Psychology](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/) @ UT Austin.

As part of PI Lab, I am currently contributing to developing [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org/) and deploying it to investigate human cognitive processes in naturalistic contexts, with a special focus on natural language. </br>
I am especially interested in using NLP architectures to model text and investigate how the human mind constructs meaning representations out of complex linguistic input. Right now, now working on integrating language models as feature extraction tools in the Neuroscout workflow through [pliers](https://github.com/tyarkoni/pliers).

I am also fascinated by how flexibly we adapt our use of language to coordinate with others and achieve goals. I am therefore very interested in research tackling the challenge of building and evaluating end-to-end dialogue systems that can simulate these highly dynamic aspects of human linguistic behavior.

I hold a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science and Semiotics](https://cc.au.dk/en/about-the-school/departments/linguistics-cognitive-science-and-semiotics/) and the [Interacting Minds Centre](https://interactingminds.au.dk/) at Aarhus University, with [Mikkel Wallentin](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/mikkel-wallentin(abf0a704-afc4-4576-9df7-3d84420bc2fc).html) as main advisor, [Kristian Tylén](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/kristian-tylen(9950d8bc-e1cd-400a-a547-359cd0b07157).html) and [Kenny Coventry](https://people.uea.ac.uk/k_coventry) as co-advisors. During my PhD, I used naturalistic fMRI, large-scale behavioral experiments, and interactive two-person paradigms to show how the way we use and process semantically underspecified words like "this", "that", "here", "there" (called "spatial demonstratives") sheds light on the key aspects of human semantic memory, neural processing of language, and addressee- and goal-oriented adaptation in interactive language use. My PhD project was part of the EU-funded Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN [DCOMM](https://www.dcomm.eu). 

Before that, I did a MSc in Cognitive Science at the [Mind and Brain Centre (CIMeC), University of Trento](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/) with a focus on computational linguistics, worked as an intern at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen](https://www.mpi.nl/), the Netherlands and at the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/), University College London. I spent one sememster at the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys) at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) as visiting PhD fellow, and visited the National Research Centre (CNR) in Rome and at the School of Psychology at University of East Anglia.

I spend a great deal of my free time between literature, music, and running.
I occasionally write fiction and non-fiction [blog posts](https://medium.com/@robertarocca) and do some freelance culture journalism (I have written for [Doppiozero](https://www.doppiozero.com/materiali/ricerca-democrazia-e-ue), [Indiscreto](https://www.indiscreto.org/tag/roberta-rocca/), [Il lavoro culturale](https://www.lavoroculturale.org/hieronymus-bosch/)) (mostly in Italian).
You may occasionally hear me play bass or piano, alone or in a [band](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1t705MCN2fPsphelEQpk3r), bore people with internationalist political views, or most often voice enthusiasm towards pretty much anything learnable.
