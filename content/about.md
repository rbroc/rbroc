Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher with [Tal Yarkoni](https://talyarkoni.org/) at Psychoinformatics Lab, [Department of Psychology](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/), UT Austin.

I hold a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science and Semiotics](https://cc.au.dk/en/about-the-school/departments/linguistics-cognitive-science-and-semiotics/) and the [Interacting Minds Centre](https://interactingminds.au.dk/) at Aarhus University. I worked under the supervision of [Mikkel Wallentin](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/mikkel-wallentin(abf0a704-afc4-4576-9df7-3d84420bc2fc).html), [Kristian Tylén](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/kristian-tylen(9950d8bc-e1cd-400a-a547-359cd0b07157).html) and [Kenny Coventry](https://people.uea.ac.uk/k_coventry) on the neural correlates of spatial demonstratives, using naturalistic imaging, large-scale behavioral experiments and interactive two-persons paradigms.

My PhD project was part of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Training Network [DCOMM](https://www.dcomm.eu), funded by the European Union under the Horizon2020 framework.

I have had the chance to study and work all around Europe. I started from a BA in Philosophy at the University of Palermo, where I got more and more interested in philosophy of language. 
Then, I did my MSc in Cognitive Science at the [Mind and Brain Centre (CIMeC), University of Trento](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/), with a focus on computational linguistics.

During my Masters, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Language and Cognition Department at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen](https://www.mpi.nl/), the Netherlands and at the Department of [Experimental Psychology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/) at University College London. 

I spend a great deal of my free time between literature, music, and politics.
I occasionally write [fiction](https://medium.com/@robertarocca) and do some freelance culture journalism (I have written for [Doppiozero](https://www.doppiozero.com/materiali/ricerca-democrazia-e-ue), [Indiscreto](https://www.indiscreto.org/tag/roberta-rocca/), [Il lavoro culturale](https://www.lavoroculturale.org/hieronymus-bosch/)).
You can occasionally also hear me playing bass, guitar or piano, alone or in a [band](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1t705MCN2fPsphelEQpk3r), or bragging about how proud I am of being a EU citizen.
