title: About
---

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Culture, Cognition and Computation @ Aarhus University. Previously, I was a postdoc at Psychoinformatics Lab @ UT Austin.

My work focuses on NLP and data science methods, applied to the study of [clinical conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06916), [cognitive processes and individual differences](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.123/), and [social and political phenomena](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/58v5d82w). I spend most of my time developing research methods, trying to make ML tools and practices more available to research communities in cognitive and social sciences, and [writing scientific papers about it](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/25152459211026864). I am also interested in humanitarian NLP, and have previously worked as [Data Fellow](https://centre.humdata.org/data-fellows/) in Predictive Analytics at the United Nations' Centre for Humanitarian Data. I am an NLP and deep learning enthusiast, motivated to help making AI fairer, more democratic, and more socially impactful.

I have been part of a number of open-source projects, including [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org/), a platform for end-to-end analysis of neuroimaging data (see [research paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79277)). As part of the Neuroscout project, I focused especially on validating and testing core analytical workflows, on implementing deep learning pipelines for the feature extraction library [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers), and on supporting expansion of feature sets and functionality. 

You can read more about my work in my [CV](https://rbroc.github.io/cv/cv.pdf), and in the [Projects](https://rbroc.github.io/projects) section of this website.
