Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher with [Tal Yarkoni](https://talyarkoni.org/) at Psychoinformatics Lab, [Department of Psychology](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/), UT Austin.

As part of Tal's lab, I am contributing to developing Neuroscout and deploying it to investigate human cognitive processes in real-life contexts, with a special focus on natural language. </br>
I am especially interested in using NLP architectures (such as Transformers) to model text, and investigate how the human mind constructs meaning representations out of long and complex naturalistic linguistic input. I am now working on integrating language models as feature extraction tools in the Neuroscout workflow through pliers. </br>
I am also fascinated by how flexibly humans use language to coordinate with others and achieve goals. I am therefore very interested in research tackling the challenge of building and evaluating end-to-end dialogue systems that can simulate these highly dynamic aspects of human linguistic behavior.

I hold a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [Department of Linguistics, Cognitive Science and Semiotics](https://cc.au.dk/en/about-the-school/departments/linguistics-cognitive-science-and-semiotics/) and the [Interacting Minds Centre](https://interactingminds.au.dk/) at Aarhus University, with [Mikkel Wallentin](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/mikkel-wallentin(abf0a704-afc4-4576-9df7-3d84420bc2fc).html) as main advisor, [Kristian Tylén](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/kristian-tylen(9950d8bc-e1cd-400a-a547-359cd0b07157).html) and [Kenny Coventry](https://people.uea.ac.uk/k_coventry) as co-advisors. During my PhD, I used naturalistic fMRI, large-scale behavioral experiments, and interactive two-person paradigms to show how the way we use and process semantically underspecified words like "this", "that", "here", "there" (called "spatial demonstratives") sheds light on the key aspects of human semantic memory, neural processing of language, and addressee- and goal-oriented adaptation in interactive language use. My PhD project was part of the EU-funded Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN [DCOMM](https://www.dcomm.eu).

I have worked and studied all around Europe. It all started in 2010 from a BA in Philosophy at the University of Palermo. Later, I did a MSc in Cognitive Science at the [Mind and Brain Centre (CIMeC), University of Trento](https://www.cimec.unitn.it/), with a focus on computational linguistics. During my Masters, I did internships at the Language and Cognition Department, [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen](https://www.mpi.nl/), the Netherlands and at the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/), University College London. 
As a PhD student, I visited the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (Section for Cognitive Systems) at the Danish Technical University (DTU), I went on short research stays at LaCaM Lab, National Research Centre (CNR) in Rome and at the School of Psychology at University of East Anglia.

I spend a great deal of my free time between literature, music, politics and running.
I occasionally write [fiction](https://medium.com/@robertarocca) and do some freelance culture journalism (I have written for [Doppiozero](https://www.doppiozero.com/materiali/ricerca-democrazia-e-ue), [Indiscreto](https://www.indiscreto.org/tag/roberta-rocca/), [Il lavoro culturale](https://www.lavoroculturale.org/hieronymus-bosch/)).
You may occasionally hear me play bass, guitar or piano, alone or in a [band](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1t705MCN2fPsphelEQpk3r), bragging about being a "citizen of the world", or voicing enthusiasm towards pretty much anything learnable.
