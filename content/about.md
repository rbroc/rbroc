title: About
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Psychoinformatics Lab, University of Texas at Austin, with a cognitive neuroscience and computational lingusitics background. </br>

My work focuses on developing research methods and open-source software for neuroscience and psychology, and it is especially centered on making ML tools and practices more available to these research communities. </br>

I have a strong interest in deep learning and data science, and in their potential for positive impact on research and social good. 
I am part of the team that develops [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org/), an open-source platform for end-to-end analysis of neuroimaging data, where I focus on workflow validation and on the implementation of deep learning feature extraction pipelines in [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers).
My other projects include experimenting with the development of transformer architectures that produce multi-level token, sequence and context (author, thread) encodings. I am also involved in an applied NLP + social science project aiming to map cross-national attitudes towards the European Union from a multilingual Twitter corpus. 
Last summer I joined the United Nations' Centre for Humanitarian Data as a Predictive Analytics Data Fellow, where I conducted research on how complex systems modeling can inform humanitarian intervention. </br>

I am currently looking for opportunities to improve my ML engineering skills while contributing to fairer, more democratic, and more socially impactful AI.
