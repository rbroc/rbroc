title: "Understanding cognitive dimensions of political identity using NLP"
description: "I am currently part of an [interdisciplinary consortium](https://interactingminds.au.dk/news/enkelt/artikel/the-transformation-of-a-european-sense-of-solidarity-visceral-politics-and-social-belonging-in-a) working on investigating factors shaping political identity at the national and transnational level. As a postdoc at the [Interacting Minds Centre](https://interactingminds.au.dk/) at Aarhus University, I am currently working on understanding which cognitive representations underlie people's attachment to national and transnational institutions using multilingual corpora of social media  data and open-text survey data. \n"
