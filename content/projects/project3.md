title: "Mapping political attitudes in the European Union using NLP"
description: "I am currently part of an [interdisciplinary consortium](https://interactingminds.au.dk/news/enkelt/artikel/the-transformation-of-a-european-sense-of-solidarity-visceral-politics-and-social-belonging-in-a) working on investigating what drives people's support and feeling of belonging in the European Union. As a part-time postdoc at the [Interacting Minds Centre](https://interactingminds.au.dk/) at Aarhus University, I am in charge of mapping drivers of social and political identity across EU countries in a data-driven fashion.  \n
Using the Twitter API (v2), I have created a large multilingual Twitter dataset (EN/DE/IT/DA/PL) containing tweets about the European Union, and I am experimenting with transformers-powered sentiment analysis and topic modeling to understand how and why support to the EU has evolved the last decade.  \n
This project is giving me the opportunity to gain familiarity with existing tools for multilingual text analysis, and to develop awareness of the need for more and better tools for low-resource languages."
