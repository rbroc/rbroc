title: "Mapping cognitive representations of political identity using NLP"
description: "I am currently part of an [interdisciplinary consortium](https://interactingminds.au.dk/news/enkelt/artikel/the-transformation-of-a-european-sense-of-solidarity-visceral-politics-and-social-belonging-in-a) working on investigating what drives people's feeling of belonging to national and transnational institutions such as the European Union. As a postdoc at the [Interacting Minds Centre](https://interactingminds.au.dk/) at Aarhus University, I am currently working on understanding, using a large multilingual corpus of social media text data and open-text survey data, which cognitive representations people's feeling of social and political belonging across European countries.  \n"
