title: "The neural underpinnings of spatial demonstratives"
description: "Spatial demonstratives are words like 'this' and 'that' used to direct manipulate people's attentional focus. They are extremely frequent, yet far from simple. Understanding what they refer to requires not only knowing language, but also the context in which they are pronounced.  \n 
As part of my PhD, I ran a naturalistic fMRI study combining synthesized dialogical narratives, fast multiband acquisition, and finite impulse response modeling to understand how the brain makes sense of them.  \n
I found that spatial words engaged dorsal regions of the brain implicated not only in language, but in various aspects of visuospatial cognition, supporting distributed views of language processing.  \n
