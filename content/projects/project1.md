title: "Neuroscout: a platform for large-scale naturalistic fMRI research"
description: "At Psychoinformatics Lab, I have contributing to the development of [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org), an end-to-end platform for the analysis of naturalistic fMRI data. You can read more about Neuroscout in our eLife paper: https://elifesciences.org/articles/79277. \n
I am focusing on expanding Neuroscout's annotation set by implementing feature extraction pipelines that use pretrained deep learning models (e.g., from HuggingFace's transformers and TensorflowHub) in [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers).  \n
I contributed to validating the platform and showing its potential to increase the generalizability of neuroimaging findings through a series of large-scale meta-analyses presented in the paper, and available as a Jupyter book [here](https://neuroscout.github.io/neuroscout-paper/intro.html)."
