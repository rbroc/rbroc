title: "Neuroscout: a platform for large-scale naturalistic fMRI research"
description: "At Psychoinformatics Lab, I am contributing to the development of Neuroscout, an end-to-end platform for the analysis fMRI data collected using naturalistic stimuli (movies, narratives, etc.).  \n
I am focusing on expanding Neuroscout's annotations set by implementing feature extraction pipelines using publicly available deep learning models (e.g., from HuggingFace's transformers and TensorflowHub) in the feature extraction library [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers).  \n
I am also contributing to validating the platform and showcasing its methodological affordances through a series of large-scale meta-analytic replications of known neuroimaging findings (preprint forthcoming), and QA testing its workflows and other components.  \n  \n
Check out [my pliers contributions](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers/graphs/contributors) and our code for the [Neuroscout validation paper](https://github.com/neuroscout/neuroscout-paper) "
