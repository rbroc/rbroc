title: "Neuroscout: a platform for large-scale naturalistic fMRI research"
description: "At Psychoinformatics Lab, I am contributing to the development of [Neuroscout](https://neuroscout.org), an end-to-end platform for the analysis fMRI data collected using naturalistic stimuli (movies, narratives, etc.).  \n
I am focusing on expanding Neuroscout's annotation set by implementing feature extraction pipelines that use publicly available deep learning models (e.g., from HuggingFace's transformers and TensorflowHub) in [pliers](https://github.com/PsychoinformaticsLab/pliers).  \n
I am also contributing to validating the platform and its affordances for large-scale neuroimaging research through a series of meta-analytic replications of known neuroimaging findings (preprint forthcoming, code [here](https://github.com/neuroscout/neuroscout-paper)), and QA testing its workflows and other components.  \n
For this project, I am working in close connection with Alejandro de la Vega, Research Scientist at UT Austin and PI for the NIH-funded Neuroscout project."
