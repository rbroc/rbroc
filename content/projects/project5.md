title: "Complex systems modeling for humanitarian action: methods and opportunities"
description: "In Summer 2021, I worked at the [United Nations' Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/) as a [Predictive Analytics Data Fellow](https://centre.humdata.org/data-fellows/). During my fellowship, I conducted research on how complex systems modeling (e.g., agent-based simulations, systems dynamics, network models) can be used to understand humanitarian crises, monitor their unfolding and simulate the effectiveness of response plans ahead of implementation.  \n
My research involved methods reviews, interviews with humanitarian actors, [preliminary data analysis](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa_cholera_sd_pilot), and a final report which introduces complex systems modeling for humanitarians and outlines recommendations on contexts and technical requirements for a pilot. The report is available [at this link](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/2048a947-5714-4220-905b-e662cbcd14c8/resource/57dd6394-7b8f-4ec1-a622-68a7ee15a04b/download/complex-systems-modeling-for-humanitarian-action-methods-and-opportunities-nov-2021.pdf), and a blog post summarizing it is available [here](https://centre.humdata.org/complex-systems-modeling-for-humanitarian-action/)."
