title: "Cognitive diversity promotes collective creativity: an agent-based simulation"
description: "I have a strong interest in social cognition, and especially in how interacting with others shapes the way we think and act. In this project (a collaboration with Kristian Tyl√©n from Aarhus University), we use agent-based simulations to investigate whether and how performing a divergent thinking task with others makes us come up with better and more creative solutions. We make artificial agents with different computationally operationalized semantic memories perform an iterative word association task.  \n
We find that, when performing the association game with a partner, agents tend to yield higher performance and produce more creative behavior.  \n
We have published a paper on the 2022 CogSci proceedings, which is available here: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/58v5d82w
Code (which will soon be tidied up!) is publicly available [here](https://github.com/rbroc/diversity_abm)."
