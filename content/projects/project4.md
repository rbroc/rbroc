title: "The benefits of cognitive diversity on creative thinking: an agent-based simulation"
description: "I have a strong interest in social cognition, and especially in how interacting with others shapes the way we think and act. In this project (a collaboration with Kristian Tyl√©n from Aarhus University), we use agent-based simulations to investigate whether and how performing a problem solving task with others makes us come up with better and more creative solutions. We make artificial agents with different word2vec models as semantic memories perform an iterative word association task.  \n
We find that, when performing the association game with a partner, agents tend to produce longer and more creative association chains, and that increasing diversity in their semantic memories promotes more creative behavior. We are currently writing this up as a short conference paper and a more extensive journal submission.  \n
Code (which will soon be tidied up!) is publicly available [here](https://github.com/rbroc/diversity_abm)."
