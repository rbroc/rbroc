title: "Cognitive diversity promotes collective creativity: an agent-based simulation"
description: "In this project (a collaboration with Kristian Tyl√©n from Aarhus University), we use agent-based simulations to investigate: a) whether and how performing a divergent thinking task with others makes us come up with better and more creative solutions; b) how this is modulated by cognitive diversity within the group.  \n
We have published a paper on the 2022 CogSci proceedings, which is available here: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/58v5d82w
Code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/rbroc/diversity_abm) and follow-ups are in progress."
