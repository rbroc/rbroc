title: "A multi-modal, multi-diagnostic approach to language-based inference of mental disorders"
description: "Together with Lasse Hansen and Riccardo Fusaroli from Aarhus University, I am working on developing and assessing  text-, audio-, and combined text-and-audio models for language-based diagnostics of psychiatric disorders in a multimodal and multiclass settings.  \n 
We have engineered a number of baseline models (using XGBoost on text and audio features) as well as transformers-based architectures predicting clinical diagnoses, and tested their performance on clinical interviews from Danish patients with ASD, schizophrenia and major depressive disorders as well as matched controls. In our forthcoming manuscript, we show how performance in multiclass settings decreases significantly compared to binary (diagnosis vs. control) prediction settings widely reported in the literature, calling for more in-depth focus on improving the specificity and, thereby, the real-world clinical utility of language- and voice-based diagnostic approaches.  \n "
